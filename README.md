**Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 - Day 3**

**Overview**  
This document highlights the progress made on Day 3 of the Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025. The day's efforts centered around:  

- Integrating APIs  
- Migrating and optimizing data  
- Addressing error handling  
- Enhancing asynchronous functionality  

**Key Achievements**  
- Achieved seamless API integration within the marketplace application.  
- Completed data migration with optimizations for better scalability and performance.  
- Resolved edge cases to ensure robust and efficient data handling.  
- Boosted application efficiency through refined asynchronous processes.

 **Sanity Schema for Product**
This schema defines the structure of the **Product** document in Sanity. It serves as the foundation for storing and managing product information in the marketplace application.  

 **Key Fields**
1. **Title (string):** The name of the product, used for display and search purposes.  
2. **Slug (slug):** A unique, URL-friendly identifier for the product.  
3. **Description (text):** Detailed information about the product, providing context for users.  
4. **Price (number):** The cost of the product, which can support various currencies.  
5. **Category (reference):** A relationship to the Category schema for better product organization.  
6. **Images (array of images):** A collection of product images to showcase the item.  
7. **Stock (number):** Tracks the availability of the product.  
8. **Tags (array of strings):** Keywords for filtering and improving search relevance.  

 **Usage**  
This schema ensures consistency across product entries, enabling efficient data handling and a seamless integration with frontend compone

 **API Fetching Code Snippet Explanation**
This code snippet demonstrates how to fetch product data from a Sanity API using a structured query. Below is a breakdown of the key components and their purpose:

 **1. Base URL**
The `BASE_URL` variable contains the endpoint for Sanityâ€™s dataset API. It combines your project ID and dataset name. Replace `<your-sanity-project-id>` and `<dataset>` with your specific details.

**2. GROQ Query**
The code uses a GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) query to fetch all documents of type `product`.  
- Selected fields include `title`, `slug`, `description`, `price`, and more.  
- The `category->title` syntax fetches the title of the referenced category document.

**3. Fetch Function**
The `fetchProducts` function sends an HTTP GET request to retrieve product data:  
- **Query Encoding**: The GROQ query is URL-encoded to ensure compatibility in the request URL.  
- **Response Handling**: The response is parsed as JSON and includes an error check to ensure successful data retrieval.

 **4. Error Handling**
If the request fails, an error message is logged, and an empty array is returned. This ensures the application does not crash due to unhandled exceptions.

**5. Example Usage**
The function call `fetchProducts()` fetches all product data and logs it to the console. This can be further integrated into the frontend to display product details.

 **Key Benefits**
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets efficiently.  
- **Customizable Queries**: Allows fine-tuning the query to fetch specific fields or filter data.  
- **Error Resilience**: Prevents application crashes by handling network or query failures.  

**importing Data into Sanity**
This guide explains how to import data into a Sanity project using both the Sanity CLI and Sanity Client in a script.

Prepare Your Data: Ensure your data is in a JSON format compatible with Sanity's schema.

Use Sanity CLI: Run the command:
sanity dataset import <path-to-json-file> <dataset-name>
Replace <path-to-json-file> with the path to your JSON file and <dataset-name> with your target dataset.

- **Key Takeaways**
- - **Error Handling:** Emphasized the need for strong error-handling mechanisms in API interactions.  
- **Data Migration:** Learned effective strategies for creating efficient and sustainable migration scripts.  
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Gained insights into optimizing processes to enhance efficiency and minimize bottlenecks.  
- **Teamwork:** Highlighted the value of collaboration and determination in overcoming complex challenges.  

**Upcoming Tasks**  
1. **UI Enhancements:** Focus on refining the user interface to deliver an improved user experience.  
2. **Shipment and Payment Integration:** Develop features for order tracking and payment gateway integration.  
3. **Deployment Preparation:** Finalize the application for deployment.  
4. **Team Collaboration:** Work closely with teammates to ensure all features are aligned and modules are seamlessly integrated.
